Three sailors get shipwrecked on an island where they find a pile of coconuts and a monkey. They agree to go to sleep and divide up the coconuts in the morning. During the night, one sailor wakes up, gives one coconut to the monkey to keep him quiet, takes exactly 1/3 of the rest, and falls back asleep. Then the second sailor wakes up and does the same. Later, the third sailor wakes up and does the same. In the morning, there are fewer than 10 coconuts left. They each take exactly 1/3 leaving no more coconuts. How many coconuts were in the original pile?
